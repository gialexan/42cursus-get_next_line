# Get_next_line 
My implementation of the get_next_line function, similar to the [fgets](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_fgets.htm) function in C and [getline](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/getline-string-in-cplusplus) in C++.

### What is get_next_line?
Get Next Line is an individual project at [42](https://www.42sp.org.br) that requires us to create a function similar to [getline](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/getline-string-in-cplusplus) from C++ and [fgets](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_fgets.htm) from C. This function allows reading a file line by line when called in a loop.

## Getting started
**Follow the steps below**
```bash
# Clone the project and access the folder
git clone https://github.com/gialexan/42cursus-get_next_line && cd 42cursus-get_next_line/
# Create a file do read
touch myfile.txt
# Write in file
echo "Test get_next_line!" > myfile.txt
# Compile the files, example:
cc main.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
# Execute your program
./a.out
# Clean output objects with
rm -f myfile.txt a.out
# Well done!
```

## Updating

The project is regularly updated with bug fixes and code optimization.
