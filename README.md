# Get_next_line 
My implementation of the get_next_line function, similar to the [fgets](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_fgets.htm) function in C and [getline](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/getline-string-in-cplusplus) from CPP.

### What is get_next_line?
Get_next_line is an individual project in [42](https://www.42sp.org.br) that requiries us to create in C a function that reads a file line after line.
