# Get_next_line 
My implementation of the get_next_line function, similar to the [fgets](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_fgets.htm) function in C and [getline](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/getline-string-in-cplusplus) from CPP.

### What is get_next_line?
Get_next_line is an individual project in [42](https://www.42sp.org.br) that requires us to create in C a function that reads a file line after line.

git clone https://github.com/gialexan/get_next_line-42 && cd get_next_line-42/
# Create a file do read
touch myfile.txt
# Write in file
echo "Test get_next_line " > myfile.txt or ls -l > myfile.txt
# Compile the files, example:
clang main.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
